# IBM Call for Code

Commit to the cause. Push for change.

Mitigating natural disasters is one of the world’s greatest challenges. The past decade has been one of the worst periods for natural disasters and while weather events may be inevitable they don’t have to become so catastrophic.

That’s why we’re launching Call for Code, a worldwide, multi-year initiative that inspires developers to solve pressing global problems with sustainable software solutions.

Create applications that improve disaster preparedness, build resilient communities, and safeguard the health and well-being of individuals and institutions.
